C++ Project 2
In this project, I am tasked to create a banking app. It is meant to be used to display static reports for users to show what future earnings looked like with compounded interest. The user would input an initial investment amount, a monthly deposit amount, an annual interest amount, and the number of years. When users continue, the console should display two static reports. 

The 1st report will show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. 
The 2nd report will show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly deposit value input by the user
